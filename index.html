	<div id="aboutus">
			<p>Hi! We are students at the University of Edinburgh, and for the past semester, we have been working on a project for <a href="https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/" target="_blank">Data, Design, and Society</a>, a class in the School of Informatics.</p>
			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<p>We are a diverse group: two first years, a second year, and a third year (exchange student), studying psychology, geography, anthropology, and informatics. Two of us live in catered facilities in Pollock Halls, and the other two of us live off campus.</p>
	</div>

			<h1>Our Project</h1>
			<p>We decided to address the problem of reducing wastage of food served in the Pollock Halls Dining Hall, in the John McIntyre Conference Center (JMCC). The JMCC provides <span class="blue">two meals a day for two thousand students</span> for nine out of twelve months of the year. <br><br>Our goal is to reduce food waste--waste from back of house and front of house. After talking with stakeholders (i.e. students who live in Pollock Halls) through surveys and focus groups, we have decided to try and solve this problem by <span class="blue">removing trays from the JMCC</span>.</p>

		<h1>Removing Trays: Real World Context</h1>
		<p id="context1">We did some research, and found a bunch of articles and studies that show the benefits--and a few negatives--that resulted from removing trays in campus dining halls. Our findings are summarised below.</p>
		
		<div id="tabs">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#tabs-1">Evironmental Impacts</a></li>
				<li><a href="#tabs-2">Economic Impacts</a></li>
				<li><a href="#tabs-3">Social Awareness</a></li>
				<li><a href="#tabs-4">Possible Concerns</a></li>
			</ul>
			<div id="tabs-1">
				<p>Taking away trays <span class="emphasis">conserves energy</span> by eliminating the need to heat water for tray washing, <span class="emphasis">reduces dependence</span> on fossil fuels, saves one-third to one-half gallon of water per tray, <span class="emphasis">reduces chemicals</span>, detergents and drying agents used to wash trays, <span class="emphasis">decreases discharge</span> into landfills, incinerators and wastewater treatment facilities, and <span class="emphasis">lessens the ecological footprint</span>.<sup>1</sup><br><br>

				A university was able to reduce food waste by <span class="emphasis">378 lbs for the trayless week</span>, which is a reduction of 0.81 oz per patron. Addtionally, <span class="emphasis">employees seemed to prefer the trayless system</span>.<sup>2</sup><br><br>

				Another study reports that there was a <span class="emphasis">32% reduction in food waste and a 27% reduction in dish use</span> when trays were made unavailable at a university dining facility.<sup>4</sup>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tabs-2">
				<p>Taking away trays saves on <span class="emphasis">cost of water and energy</span>, saves on <span class="emphasis">cost of detergents</span> and rinse/drying agents, <span class="emphasis">eliminates cost of trays</span>, and <span class="emphasis">reduces food-waste removal</span> costs.<sup>1</sup><br><br>

				Schools which go trayless for one day per week <span class="emphasis">reduce waste by an average of 1/3</span> on those days with some reporting as much as a 50% reduction, and leading to considerable savings. For example, San Diego State University <span class="emphasis">reduced food cost by 4.9%</span> by going totally trayless, and Driscoll University has <span class="emphasis">saved an estimated 70 gallons of water</span> for every day the dining halls do not use trays.<sup>3</sup>	
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tabs-3">
				<p>Taking away trays supports <span class="emphasis">education and awareness</span> of environmental issues, reinforces institutions' <span class="emphasis">sustainability initiatives</span>, encourages students to <span class="emphasis">participate in a "green" initiative</span> that has both a personal and community impact, and <span class="emphasis">reinforces sustainability awareness</span> on a daily basis.<sup>1</sup><br><br>

				Brian Wansink (Cornell University) has written extensively about a habit he terms <span class="emphasis">"mindless eating"</span>, a concept meaning the bigger your plate, the more you'll eat even if you aren't hungry or know better. <span class="emphasis">Going trayless can be promoted as a health and wellness initiative</span> that will encourage students to take smaller portions.<sup>3</sup>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="tabs-4">
				<p>One study found that a concern could be <span class="emphasis">increased breakage of dishware and the increased need to wipe down tables</span>.<sup>2</sup><br><br>

				Student complaints on the Reddit thread included: having to make <span class="emphasis">multiple trips</span> to get enough food, the conveyer belt for tray <span class="emphasis">disposal was awkward to use with plates</span>, the costs saved from getting rid of trays <span class="emphasis">did not translate into a cheaper meal plan</span>, it is a lot <span class="emphasis">easier to spill food</span>, and there are other ways to be green and <span class="emphasis">make the food waste better, which would result in less waste</span>.<sup>5</sup>
